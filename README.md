# keycloak-dotnet-example

This repository is a .NET Aspire solution that implements authentication and authoriziation using keycloak as an identity provider with the BFF pattern.
I used the solution from the aspire playground as a base and added a little more to make the logout work aswell.

To make finding the code changes needed to add keycloak authentication easier, you can search "KeycloakExample" over the entire solution.
